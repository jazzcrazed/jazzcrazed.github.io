<p>Parnis is a Chinese mechanical watch maker specializing in homages to popular
styles. The ones that drew my attention are their &ldquo;pilot&rdquo;-styled
hand-winding watches. I just recently got one &mdash; unbranded, with the
seconds subdial at the 9-o-clock &mdash; and it&rsquo;s pretty&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>
  I love mechanical watches. Despite being significantly less accurate than
  pretty much every other watch technology since the 1950s (like quartz),
  there&rsquo;s something beautiful and elegant in the tiny gears and springs of
  mechanical movements, which also never need batteries. My first mechanical
  watch is a diver: the
  <a href="http://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en/gents/khaki/navy/navy-gmt/H77615133">
    Hamilton Khaki Navy <span class="caps">GMT</span></a>. It&rsquo;s an automatic with screw-down crowns
  &mdash; robust, heavy, beautiful, and complicated with several rotating
  bezels. In looking for a second watch, I wanted something simpler and more&nbsp;elegant.
</p>

<figure class="right">

    <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5734428130284003634">

    </a>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>
  I&rsquo;m drawn to pilot watches for the same reasons early 20<span class="ord">th</span>-century
  pilots found them appealing: because of the legibility of the heavy white
  sans-serif numerals on large black dials. And in making my rounds of watch
  forums and blogs, I came across Chinese watchmakers like Parnis doing them on
  the&nbsp;cheap.
</p>

<p>
  This is actually my second Chinese hand-wound watch. I previously bought a
  Garton pilot watch that I also really loved. But one day, I made the poor
  decision of letting it get near-soaking wet. The dial casement popped off not
  long after, and then the movement just plain stopped working. I could have
  gotten it repaired, but it would have costed better than 50% of the original
  sub-$100 cost. These are not water-resistant watches, which is definitely
  worth keeping in&nbsp;mind.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, months after the Garton broke, I ordered the
  &ldquo;<a href="http://manbushijie.com/productshow-341-6.html">44mm Black Dial
    Special@9 White Number Asian 6497</a>,&rdquo; (whew) which I picked
  mostly because I loved the typography and the red &ldquo;60&rdquo;
  on the seconds subdial. <a href="http://manbushijie.com">Manbushijie.com</a>
  (heavily endorsed by forums as one of the most reliable Chinese watch sources)
  lists it at $86, but once I registered, prices all across the site dropped by
  about a quarter, and I was able to nab this one at $69 including shipping from
  China. A little weird, since I&rsquo;m pretty sure registration is required to
  order anything. Anyway, about three weeks later, the watch arrived flat in a
  padded envelope and swathed in bubble&nbsp;wrap.

    case. Note the lighter weight numerals and markings on the Special@9.

</figure>

<p>
  The first thing I noticed after I unwrapped the &ldquo;Special@9&rdquo;
  is how large the dial seems. It&rsquo;s the same 44mm as the Garton I got
  before it, but the numbers and minute markers are a hair lighter weight. Also,
  the markers are about a millimeter shorter, placing the numerals at a wider
  radius. Combined with the lack of any branding, there&rsquo;s a lot more
  whitespace (or blackspace) than the Garton. This also makes the dial feel
  cleaner and more elegant, but it feels a tad oversized on my sub-7” wrist. If
  everything were drawn in by around two millimeters, it would be&nbsp;perfect.
</p>

<p>
  That said, the numerals are clean and lovely, and I&rsquo;m particularly fond
  of the seconds subdial. It&rsquo;s got radial ridges, like a vinyl record,
  that give it a sort of metallic gleam when light hits it. The seconds numerals
  are set in the same typeface as the minutes (unlike the Garton, which used a
  serif face and looked a bit awkward), and the subdial itself feels cleanly
  placed, cropping the 10 and 8 at the 9-o-clock&nbsp;position.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <div class="curledShadow">
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5734343122564986162">

    </a>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>
  The case is simple stainless steel, polished on top and
  bottom, and brushed along the sides. On the 9-o-clock side of the
  case, opposite the crown, its got a simple art-deco-ish ornamentation that on
  the one hand is completely inoffensive but on the other sort of breaks the
  minimalism of the dead-simple case. It&rsquo;s also got a transparent glass
  caseback that displays the movement &mdash; a pretty 6497 clone with some
  blue screws, pink rubies, and engraved&nbsp;metal.
</p>

<p>
  Like many pilot watches (and the Garton before it), the Special@9 has a huge
  diamond-shaped crown that winds the power spring when turned clockwise.
  Pull the crown out, and the time can be set by turning in either direction.
  The seconds do not stop when the crown is pulled (a concept known as
  &ldquo;hacking,&rdquo; making it easier synchronize); usually, I try to hold
  the minute hand exactly on a minute marker before pushing the crown back to
  help ensure the hands are in&nbsp;sync.

<p>
  One thing of note, which is also common amongst these Chinese mechanicals,
  is that the movement is quite loud. Imagine the signature sound of the
  <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFjt_fV8hPU">60 Minutes</a></em>
  clock audible from a foot away in relative quiet. I actually like the noise,
  but my fiance&#233; isn&rsquo;t into it; if we&rsquo;re sitting next to each
  other, and I&rsquo;m leaning my head in my left hand (not an unusual posture
  for anyone), then she can hear and is quite distracted by the sound of the
  rotor in action. Whereas for me, after regular wear for the past few weeks,
  the ticking has become pleasant white&nbsp;noise.
</p>

<p>
  Also like many pilot watches, the numerals, hands, and markers are coated
  in luminous paint. It&rsquo;s a standard green, like that used on my Hamilton,
  but not as immediately bright. For me, the important part of lume is duration,
  and the Garton excelled at this; I would be able to read the watch late into
  a two-hour movie at a theater, which is far longer than the Hamilton. This
  Parnis, however, doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the same duration as the Garton.
  The Garton also uses blue lume, as opposed to the green on the Hamilton and
  Parnis, which could be a factor. I suppose I just need to watch more
  interesting movies when wearing the&nbsp;Special@9.

<p>
  One of the unsurprising downsides of cheap watches like those from Parnis and
  Garton is the strap, which is wholly unremarkable, stiff leather. I actually
  prefer the strap of the Garton, which is thinner and more pliable than the
  Special@9. It&rsquo;s also a nice color &mdash; a reddish brown that contrasts
  well with the charcoal colored Garton case. At a distance, the thick and dark
  brown strap of the Special@9, with its white contrast stitching, seems fine
  next to the polished stainless steel case &mdash; it actually looks rather
  classic. Spending a minute to look closer, though, and it looks and feels
  plasticky. Still, with regular wearing, the strap becomes softer, and
  I&rsquo;ve warmed to it enough that I&rsquo;m not clamoring to replace it with
  something nicer. Also, since it&rsquo;s so cheap, I didn&rsquo;t feel the least
  bit squeamish about taking a razor to it to dig out a new hole to accommodate
  my thin wrist (which I also did with the Garton, which has an even longer&nbsp;strap).
</p>

<p>
  After about a month of wearing, the watch has become a comfortable wrist
  presence. I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I&rsquo;d missed cranking a manual
  movement, and like the Garton before it, I never let the spring run out.
  The movement runs fast &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t measure the divergence precisely
  since I never cared for ultra-precise timekeeping (if I did, I wouldn&rsquo;t
  be into mechanical watches), but it&rsquo;s maybe something like a minute
  gained a week. Thanks to the simplicity of the watch, it&rsquo;s no problem
  readjusting once a week or so. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably indirectly helped
  me be early to&nbsp;appointments.

</figure>

<p>
  Something I was harshly reminded of one morning is the lack of weatherproofing.
  On a particularly humid day recently, I awoke to condensation on the inside
  of the watch. The lack of any kind of gasket-like seal means that moisture
  can easily sneak in, and if not removed promptly can cause corrosion of the
  tiny metal parts. Normally, this means a trip to the watch repairer; but,
  since the Special@9 isn&rsquo;t very sealed, I pulled out the crown, put it
  in a bag with uncooked rice overnight, and the next morning the condensation
  was&nbsp;gone.
</p>

<p>
  I have several nitpicks with the Special@9 compared to the Garton that
  preceded it &mdash; the lighter weight numerals and markers and lack of
  branding make the dial seemed oversized, and the lume is unimpressive, as is
  the strap. But it&rsquo;s readable and cleanly designed &mdash; exemplary of
  the pilot watch style. It&rsquo;s accurate enough for my tastes, the movement
  is beautiful and fun to wind, and at $70 shipped, it&rsquo;s a great value.
  I think I&rsquo;ll dress it up in the future with new hands and a strap, but
  even in its out-of-the-envelope state, it&rsquo;s totally fine.  I&rsquo;ll be
  shopping Parnis again in the future, for&nbsp;sure.
