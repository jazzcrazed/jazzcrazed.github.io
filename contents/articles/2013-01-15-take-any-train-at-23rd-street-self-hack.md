<p>
  One of my New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions (really, the only one with a specific
  action) is to write a blog post at least once a week. The idea is that
  I&rsquo;ll get better at writing with frequency. As you can tell, I&rsquo;m
  already behind, but here&rsquo;s to catching up!
</p>

<p>
  Part of fulfilling my quantity-for-better-quality strategy means smaller,
  sillier posts (as if my prior posts bore any heft) like this one, in which I
  simply write a tip to myself whenever I find myself on the local-only
  downtown platform of the 23rd Street and 8th Avenue subway stop.

<p>
  The tip?
</p>

<blockquote class="big quotation">
  When going to Brooklyn, take <i>*any*</i> train that arrives.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Why give myself this sort of advice? Because I&rsquo;m a little obsessed about
  minimizing trips on NYC public transit (I &ldquo;pre-walk&rdquo; &mdash;
  move to the part of a platform or train where the door is closest to the
  exit at the destination &mdash; nearly 100% of the time, for instance), and
  recently I made the mistake of not getting on board a downtown-bound E train
  (which terminates in downtown Manhattan, and doesn&rsquo;t reach my ultimate
  transfer to the G in Brooklyn) that arrived at 23rd street in anticipation
  of riding a C train all the way to Brooklyn.
</p>

<p>
  The fact is, either train would have taken me to the next stop, 14th street,
  where I could have transferred either to an A from a C, if one happened to be
  arriving then, or from an E to either an A or a C &mdash; whichever came
  first. At worst, I would have ended up waiting for the very same C train,
  and at best (which ended up being the reality that I passed up on), I would
  have caught an arriving A and been well on my way to Brooklyn well before a
  C finally arrived.
</p>

<p>
  I was thinking I would have been more comfortable taking the C all the way
  (the quite viable &ldquo;reduce transfers&rdquo; strategy), but even in the
  worst case, I&rsquo;d at least be waiting at 14th street for the C, which,
  with its numerous benches and lovely
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Underground">Tom Otterness</a>
  sculptures, is far more comfortable a waiting place than 23rd, where passing
  A express trains just serve to aggravate standing passengers-to-be.
</p>

<p>
  So, note to self: always board any local train that arrives at
  the 23rd street downtown/Brooklyn bound platform. And also try not to obsess
  about transit so much.
