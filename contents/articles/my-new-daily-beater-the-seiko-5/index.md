  I&rsquo;ve been wanting for a while a more practical
  daily-use watch. One that is clearly readable in light and dark, not
  oversized, water resistant, and shows the date. I&rsquo;m surprised it took me
  this long to find all that in Seiko&rsquo;s venerable &ldquo;5&rdquo; series.

My [Parnis pilot watch](/2012/04/23/parnis-manual-wind-watches),
while running strong and looking great for a year, at 44mm was starting to feel
large on the wrist. My Hamilton at 42mm was not much better &mdash; and
thanks to its complicated automatic movement was thicker and heavier. I also
missed having a watch, like my old busted Garton, that would be readable for a
couple of hours in a dark movie theater &mdash; which neither of the
above could accomplish.

![The Seiko box](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-I48erprXOlY/UZkS959BYCI/AAAAAAAANP4/lbTXD5Zl2fk/w1197-h898-no/P5089682.jpg "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879751643246977058?pid=5879751643246977058&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

The &ldquo;5&rdquo; is a line of workhorse automatics by Japanese
horological titan, [Seiko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko), that
meet five criteria: unbreakable mainspring, shock resistance,
water resistance, automatic movement, and a day/date complication (according
to the [Seiko Branding Dictionary](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f281/seiko-branding-dictionary-209014.html)
on [WatchUSeek](http://watchuseek.com). They also frequently meet one
more: extremely long-lasting visible glow-in-the-dark lume. And a
seventh criteria: [often costing under $100](https://www.google.com/search?q=seiko+5+site%3Aamazon.com&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US505&aq=f&oq=seiko+5+site%3Aamazon.com&aqs=chrome.0.57.2809j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=seiko+5&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US505&source=univ&tbm=shop&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=0I2aUb7BF8Lv0gG15IDAAg&ved=0CC4Qsxg&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.46751780,d.dmg&fp=6f14e6494ed75bed&biw=1440&bih=828). It&rsquo;s a wonder I never happened
on these when I first sought a mechanical watch.

## A Dress Watch in the SNKL29 ##

![Most Seiko 5s, including the SNKL29, come with a steel bracelet that I&rsquo;m fond of not using.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MIRNBlMM9gg/UZkTLEDBCKI/AAAAAAAANQQ/8EIfL9amc7k/w947-h710-no/P5089685.jpg?align=right "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879751869294774434?pid=5879751869294774434&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

I made a decent excuse to get my first Seiko 5: I needed a good dress watch for
the occasional wedding. It had to sport a white or silver dial, and look good
with a black leather strap. The [SNKL29](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051IYQ06/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
at $64 was a bargain match. I loved the watch so much that I got it a
[brown leather strap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0PTO6/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
for near-daily use. It really sort of blew me away with how much watch it was
for the money. Just for the terrific day *and* date display, and perfect 38mm
size, I&rsquo;d be happy. But it sports a beautiful dial with lovely and classic
printed Roman numerals around a simple track of second markings that also sport
shockingly strong dot lume at the hours. The plongeur-style hands are
also exceedingly readable through the night. Literally &mdash; I could
still read the time in the darkness of extremely early morning (the few
times I was awake).

![The Seiko SNKL07 and SNKL29. The 29 has an 18mm lug width, while the 07 has a 20mm.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0kskuCcKyI4/UZrodplTYaI/AAAAAAAANSk/Pfqne558zgA/w947-h710-no/P5170134.jpg?align=left "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5880267859561767330?pid=5880267859561767330&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

One important thing to note is that the SNKL29 sports an 18mm lug width
&mdash; *not* the 19mm specified on its Amazon page. This was annoying
when I got my 19mm straps, as I had to shave a bit off of them to fit.
It&rsquo;s also got a silver dial &mdash; not white. I actually think
white would feel dressier, but the silver has a nice sheen, and
there&rsquo;s a kind of pinstripe guilloche-like effect inside the
seconds track.

## The Perfect Daily Beater in the SNKL07 ##
Recently, I came across [this photo of the SNKL09](http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t363/kmusky68/snkl09/DSCN02172.jpg)
in [this addictive thread](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/show-off-your-seiko-5-a-702513.html),
and fell in love. The big hour markers, the black dial mated with an army-green
canvas strap, the fire-red second hand&hellip; I knew my days with just
one Seiko were numbered.

I&rsquo;d placed both the 09 and its Navy sibling, the SNKL07, into my Amazon
wishlist. The 07 dipped below $65 a few weeks ago, and I took the bait.

![The SNKL29 has a smaller, inset crown, while the SNKL07&rsquo;s is sized and placed more traditionally at 3-o-clock.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jJ9-XLUKyGw/UZkTRAWfVoI/AAAAAAAANQg/8iVZixy8q_A/w949-h712-no/P5170136.jpg?align=right "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879751971381925506?pid=5879751971381925506&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

Other than the obvious dial color difference, the 07 has a white instead
of red second-hand, and a white background to the day/date. This
actually makes it feel more formal in my mind than the military-like 09.
Compared to the dressier silver-faced 29, it&rsquo;s around the same diameter,
but the crown is larger and placed more traditionally at the 3-o-clock.
On the 29, the tiny inset crown helps maintain a clean look on a dressy
watch, though it can be hard to access; on the 07, it&rsquo;s more practically
sized and positioned for a much more general-use watch.

![The SNKL07 on an olive nylon strap.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pNk3U2Za5eo/UZkTd4HiKZI/AAAAAAAANRI/68eGlbfrBl0/w947-h710-no/P5180148.jpg?align=left "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752192510011794?pid=5879752192510011794&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

Despite not feeling as military as its black-dialed red-handed 09
brother, the 07 is still gorgeous. It looks good on my [olive-green NATO
strap]({% post_url 2012-07-29-nato-style-straps-rock %}), but like my 
Hamilton this deep navy watch looks great with light browns. With a 20mm lug
width, it can accommodate all of my existing straps, and I found its
ultimate pairing with my thick caramel-colored NATO leather strap.
It&rsquo;s a bit weathered of a strap after accommodating the
harsh-edged 44mm Parnis for so long, but I&rsquo;ve come to enjoy the
added texture. It&rsquo;s literally become pretty much my daily watch.

![The navy dial matches much better with caramel leather.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IAU8oQmYL_E/UZkTgCVHMYI/AAAAAAAANRQ/4OpamtUqPK4/w1197-h898-no/P5180149.jpg "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752229611057538?pid=5879752229611057538&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

## Seiko 5 Features ##
![38mm is clearly smaller than 44. The Parnis is slightly skinnier, though.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qMDI8gN7pKU/UZkTbFtIAOI/AAAAAAAANRA/LIJusLbUQrU/w1198-h898-no/P5170139.jpg?align=right "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752144617734370?pid=5879752144617734370&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

Both Seikos are perfectly sized at around 38mm in diameter, and
relatively narrow and light. They aren&rsquo;t quite as skinny as my
Parnis, which is understandable as an automatic movement is typically
thicker than a manual-wind (also, undoubtedly the water resistance adds
girth thanks to things like gaskets), but they&rsquo;re not thick
either, and are obviously narrower in diameter and look more proportional
on my skinny wrists.

The movement in both is, like nearly all Seiko 5s, the [7S26](https://watchotaku.atlassian.net/wiki/display/swr/Seiko+7S26).

It&rsquo;s an automatic movement that is the result of decades of
polish and streamlining by Seiko to the point where they could churn
these out blind. It&rsquo;s undecorated and purely utilitarian &mdash;
the print on the back claims 21 jewels, but none are really visible
through the transparent casebacks on my 07 or 29. Like all mechanical
watches, it&rsquo;s not going to be as accurate as a quartz. But I
realize after years on mechanical watches that I don&rsquo;t really
notice or care about the inaccuracy.

![Seiko&rsquo;s workhorse automatic movement: the 7S26.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N6PuCDTggO4/UZkTU7d2iBI/AAAAAAAANQo/4-BQCcSp6vw/w946-h710-no/P5170137.jpg?align=left "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752038790105106?pid=5879752038790105106&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

The day/date function on both watches is about as good as it gets. First
off, you get the *day*, while most watches are content with just the
date. Who cares that I usually always remember the day of the week?
There are less useful complications out in the watch world.
There&rsquo;s also the option of Spanish rather than English days. Also,
&ldquo;SAT&rdquo; takes on a nice baby blue, while &ldquo;SUN&rdquo; is a
striking red.

And the lume really deserves reiteration. I&rsquo;m spoiled for
watch lume thanks to these Seikos, to the point that the lume on my other
watches make little sense in comparison. I wasn&rsquo;t kidding that
these are readable after hours in the dark. And I don&rsquo;t explicitly
&ldquo;charge&rdquo; these watches &mdash; this is just with the general office
light and sunlight they receive during a rather average (I think) workday.

![The Seiko lume is plenty for me. Parnis&rsquo; is barely there, which is too bad because it has an awesome dial.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-c0zhfroVh1g/UZr034E2lsI/AAAAAAAANTE/XK-z8htfAZc/w1437-h736-no/P5180146.jpg "https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5728262585017161025/5879752161044979890?pid=5879752161044979890&amp;oid=101625155591132408533")

## Other 5s&hellip; ##
It&rsquo;ll be hard to make the 07 my last Seiko. It might swing too closely to
the 09 (I&rsquo;d sooner just have the second hand replaced for a red one than
also nab the 9). But at least half a dozen Seiko 5s from the amazing
[WatchUSeek thread](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f281/seiko-branding-dictionary-209014.html)
have made it to my wishlist or bookmarks. Like the sporty [SNKK27K1](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/show-off-your-seiko-5-a-702513-4.html#post5135874),
which looks especially great on tan leather. Or the [SNZJ63](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/show-off-your-seiko-5-a-702513-9.html#post5270388).
Or for ultra readability, the [SNK381](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f21/understated-snk381-310921.html)
seems hard to beat.

And when it comes to a reliable and affordable automatic it seems hard to beat
the Seiko 5 series in general.
