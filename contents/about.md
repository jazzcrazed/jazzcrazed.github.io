I'm Marco Carag, a <del>Brooklyn</del> Queens-based web
developer.

Currently, I'm a full-stack engineer for [Telecast](http://teleca.st) in the
[Flatiron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatiron_District) area of Manhattan,
NY. Previously, I was a developer for online menswear company
[Bonobos](http://www.bonobos.com), dating startup
[HowAboutWe](http://www.howaboutwe.com), frontend manager
for [The Knot](http://www.theknot.com), and a dev manager for
[Everyday Health](http://www.everydayhealth.com). I also help organize
[BKLYN Green Drinks](http://bklyn.gd).

I have a degree in Communications Design from
[Pratt Institute](http://www.pratt.edu) that is probably rather
underutilized today.

When not coding (which is often) or not hanging out with my beautiful wife
(which is rarely), I enjoy listening to or performing
Latin music, [Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIM),
single-malt whiskey, [over-dressing](/tag/fashion/1/),
[trying to use my camera](/2012/07/25/just-upgraded-to-olympus-e-p3/), and
playing video games.

In fact, you could say video games are what got me into web development in the
first place. Since elementary school, I was so into gaming that I wrote fiction
about or inspired by them. Actually, my most
[recent](http://web.archive.org/web/19970606000158/http://www.interplay.com/descent/first.html)
[efforts](http://www.angelfire.com/games2/fsarchive/flamefront.html) (we're
talking late 1990s here) garnered enough attention to warrant a couple of my
very first websites (which will take some serious web archaeology to dig up if
you care). I also helped run an online gaming group for my then
[favorite game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)), which --
during the era of 56k modems and 5MB web hosts -- inspired several more websites.

To finish, here's another stupid fact about me: I made the "Star Trek Generations Overture"
[MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) on [this page](http://www.vic-fontaine.com/tng.php)
(the one with 3 stars next to it).
