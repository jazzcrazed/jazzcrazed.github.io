  Around five years ago, I first met Chino, Eddie, Hensy, and Tosso when they
  were part of a traditional Cuban band named Conjunto Guantanamo. They
  performed regularly at one of my favorite bars near my work in DUMBO.

    The ever-smiling, and fiery handed Eddie Valentin, probably the nicest
    bongosero you&rsquo;ll ever meet. Hensy is on bass next to him, then Chino,
    and Tosso on tres guitar.

  Chino and I became close friends shortly after, giving me tips on everything
  from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clave_(rhythm)">clave</a>,
  to West Village pizza joints and jam sessions,
  to seeking shelter during penniless times under the Manhattan Bridge (some
  tips more useful than others, but all memorable). And by introducing
  me to New York&rsquo;s incredible Latin music scene, he helped pry open an
  unexpected chapter of my life: as a passably decent amateur musician. In my
  craziest times, I pulled my violin out as often as five nights a week with a
  variety of Cuban and salsa bands in the city and met dozens of awesome
  musicians and dancers, before exhaustion caught up with me and I realized I
  couldn&rsquo;t do that anymore while I still had a day job.

<p>
  A terrific singer and spectacular dancer from Cuba, he now leads his friends in
  a band named <a href="http://www.grupoirek.com">Grupo Ir&#233;k</a>, which for
  years now has performed Saturday nights in Carroll Gardens at a restaurant
  named <a href="http://www.paneevinony.com">Pane e Vino</a>. It&rsquo;s a great
  night of music that draws many awesome dancers, and I highly recommend it if
  you&rsquo;re in the area and looking for something to do on Saturday night.

  classic Salsa tracks from the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_Lavoe">H&#233;ctor Lavoe</a>
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Blades">Rúben Blades</a>, and
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_(album)">Buena
    Vista Social Club</a> standards,
  they also gig at the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/top-of-the-standard-new-york">
    Boom Boom Room</a> at the top of the near impossibly swanky
  <a href="http://www.standardhotels.com">Standard Hotel</a> (Hensy, the bassist,
  recounted one guest putting down $4,000 on a single bottle of champagne), and
  the chic <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/bar/thoms_bar/">Thom&rsquo;s Bar</a>
  in SoHo. I haven&rsquo;t seen them perform at either of those spots, but I think
  Grupo Ir&#233;k is at their best with smooth-moving dancers filling the floor
  in front of them, and not as the background music to expensive martini sipping
  (though, I&rsquo;d wager the latter pays better).

  I remember one gig maybe four years ago at the Upper East Side club <a href="http://www.session73.com/">
    Session 73</a> at one of their Monday Salsa nights. The band was filled out
  with the incomparable trombonist <a href="http://www.reutregev.com/">Reut Regev</a>,
  and a pianist, with barely enough room for me nestled behind the sound
  board to stand and await a solo, watching a hundred <em>excellent</em>,
  <em>excellent</em> dancers move like I&rsquo;d never seen before. But then the
  <em>coro</em> reached its end, the band stepped back, and I gulped and stepped
  forward. Terrifying, fun, exhilarating, and unforgettable.

<p>
  Incidentally, years later, they sound better than ever. Please go
  <a href="www.grupoirek.com/schedule.html">check them out</a>, as they are awesome!
