  Been yearning to do neckwear outside of the usual business, formal, and
  Halloween situations, and I finally decided to give it an earnest shot this
  Spring starting with my very first silk knit ties. I bought two from one of my
  favorite sources for accessory experimentation:
  <a href="https://www.c21stores.com">Century 21</a> in the Financial District.
</p>

<p>
  Seemingly always overrun by tourists, Century 21 can be overwhelming and
  is often hit-or-miss. But it&rsquo;s great for cheap experiments in
  accessorizing, such as for ties and pocket squares. The one I&rsquo;m trying
  here is by a company I&rsquo;d never heard of before called Burma Bibas, and
  costed around $10. I also got a black and purple (goth colors, my fiancee
  notes) horizontal striped Ralph Lauren for around $17.
</p>

  Since this was during one of the more precipitous days in recent weeks (April
  flowers brought May showers in NYC), I&rsquo;m also donning a
  <a href="http://www.uniqlo.com">Uniqlo</a>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackintosh">mac</a> coat and my favorite
  rain boots from
