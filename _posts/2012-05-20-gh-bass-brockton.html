  I&rsquo;ve got a thing for navy shoes in the warmer months &mdash;
  they&rsquo;re versatile like brown shoes, but bring a more vibrant
  contrast to already brown-hued khaki pants. My fiancee recently turned
  me to <a href="http://bassshoes.harborghb.com">Bass</a>, a 136-year-old
  Maine-based company I&rsquo;d known solely for the loafers of my parent&rsquo;s
  generation, as an affordable source for this shoe. After getting these,
  it&rsquo;s clear that I didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to the company over
  the years.

  Got a pair of their &ldquo;Brockton&rdquo; model in &ldquo;Denim Blue&rdquo; nubuck off of
  <a href="http://www.zappos.com/bass-brockton-denim?zlfid=111&recoName=zap_pdp_sub&zfcTest=fw:0">Zappos</a>
  for the relatively bargain price of $65. They also produce the more expensive
  but very similar-looking <a href="http://www.zappos.com/bass-buckingham-navy?zlfid=111&recoName=zap_pdp_sub&zfcTest=fw:0">Buckingham</a>
  model, boasting white contrast laces and stitching and what looks to be finer
  grained and darker navy nubuck. I likely would have preferred the darker color,
  but as this was my first pair of Bass, I wanted to scout the fit of the brand.
  I&rsquo;m a difficult size almost never found in stores &mdash; 6.5 wide
  &mdash; so scouting means using sites like Zappos with excellent return policies.

    The Brocktons are soft, pliable, and comfortable out of the box. I&rsquo;ve
    stuffed them with <a href="http://www.powersteps.com/">Powerstep</a> insoles
    for additional comfort, and to bring the size 7 shoes down to my level.

<p>
  Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve got no reason to return them, despite Zappos not
  stocking them in 6.5 wide; most shoe producers have 7 as their bottom size.
  In 7 medium, they are clearly on the long side, but a nice third-party insole
  makes them comfortably snug. I&rsquo;ve also gotten cheated by 6.5 wide shoes
  that are too small (Sebago, I&rsquo;m looking at you), and that&rsquo;s much
  more difficult to rectify, so being able to use insoles to make 7 wearable is
  a welcome option.

    I like navy shoes underneath otherwise dull khakis.

<p>
  The nubuck is really soft, and the rubber sole is quite pliable, making them
  comfortable to walk in right off the bat &mdash; more like a sneaker than
  leather-soled dress shoes. And they also come in a bunch of other colors,
  like the classic seersucker-and-mint-julep-ready,
  can&rsquo;t-wait-until-Memorial-Day
  <a href="http://www.onlineshoes.com/mens-bass-brockton-white-nubuck-p_id183220">
    white nubuck over red sole</a> that my fiancee constantly convinces me I
  don&rsquo;t need. They don&rsquo;t have my size anymore, anyway, so whatever.
  But if they have yours, I heartily recommend them!
