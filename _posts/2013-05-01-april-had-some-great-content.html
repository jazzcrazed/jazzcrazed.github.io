title: "April Had Some Great Dev Culture Content"
description:
  Don&rsquo;t know what it is about April, but there were a lot of great posts
  and presentations about development team culture that really struck a chord
  in me. Here are a few faves; take a look if you haven&rsquo;t already.

      Manifesto for Minimalist Software Engineers
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    I noticed this &ldquo;minifesto&rdquo; by New York software developer,
    <a href="http://pabloguevara.com/" target="_blank">Pablo Guevara</a>, when
    it got Twitter buzz sometime in the early half of April, and have been
    mentally repeating parts of it in my head as a mantra ever since.
    &ldquo;First do it, then do it right, then do it better.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Fail fast, learn soon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Techincal Skill is the mastery
    of complexity, while <em>Creativity</em> is the master of simplicity.&rdquo;

      Bacon is Bad For You
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This is a presentation done by the amazing Austin-based frontend developer,
    <a href="http://www.garann.com/" target="_blank">Garann Means</a>, for
    <a href="http://devslovebacon.com/" target="_blank">BACON conference</a> in
    which she voices her concerns about developer monoculture, and how it can
    deter people. Truly hit home for me as someone who&rsquo;s felt alienated
    on certain dev teams, and who&rsquo;s probably done his share of alienating
    on others. <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garann/bacon-is-bad-for-you"
      _target="blank">The slides</a> speak terrifically for themselves if you
    can&rsquo;t spare the full half hour for the video. Especially love the
    comparison between the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; working professional, versus
    the professional developer.

      Cultural Confusion
    </a>

    This is a post by Jason Stirman (Medium, Twitter) for
    <a href="http://www.medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a> (a new-ish and
    beautiful kind-of-collaborative sort-of-blog&hellip;It&rsquo;s tricky to
    describe) in which he basically <em>nails it</em> in terms of what&rsquo;s
    important in forming a healthy culture: the people! There are a couple of
    great points he touches on: having a diversity of opinion, humility, making
    sure you actually <em>get along</em> with the candidates you&rsquo;re
    considering. It&rsquo;s easy to ignore how important personality is when
    staring down a list of awesome work history and accomplishments on
    someone&rsquo;s resum&#233;. Love his &ldquo;airport test&rdquo; idea. And
    this:

    <blockquote class="big quotation">
      &ldquo;The damage a bad culture fit can cause isnâ€™t worth the productivity
      they can provide.&rdquo;
    </blockquote>

  I&rsquo;ve been learning lately the sorts of things that matter to me in a
  work environment, and I realize I can distill it down to this: don&rsquo;t
  hire or be a jerk. Be humble. Solicit feedback. Trust others, and work
  together.
</p>

<p>
  Just like any community of people, it&rsquo;s hard sometimes to remember that
  you&rsquo;re all on the same team. Being individual is important, but be
  careful to avoid selfishness. It&rsquo;s crazy how often I have to remind
  myself of that.
