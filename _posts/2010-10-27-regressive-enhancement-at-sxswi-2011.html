  Just a quick one here, urging you to vote for the
  <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/6769">Regressive Enhancement,
  or Use HTML5 Today!</a> panel for <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">SXSWi
  2011</a>. Because I can find no better reason to go than to see a couple of
  friends of mine on stage. (Maybe the BBQ.) Also congrats to
  <a href="http://miketaylr.com">Mike Taylor</a>, one of the speakers, for his
  brand spanking new gig at <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>!
