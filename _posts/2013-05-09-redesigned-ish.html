title: "Redesigned-ish"
description:
  Been having the itch since the beginning of the year to make some changes to
  my year-old site design. So I worked on it on-and-off for several days, and
  launched it last week. In addition to some small clean-up, I&rsquo;ve changed
  some fonts and colors. I&rsquo;d barely want to call it a
  &ldquo;redesign&rdquo; at all, but there are some fun details I want to note.

  Colors were the biggest deal for me. I was so done with the white over deep
  navy, and the radioactive green &mdash; it started to grate on me. So I
  sought a more neutral and calming palette. I still liked the letterpress feel,
  so I picked a cream color that could be like paper. And all of the type now
  has a subtle bevel.
</p>

<p>
  The next obvious change are fonts. Picking new type probably took the most
  time. I didn&rsquo;t change the logotype, because I still like
  <a href="http://www.smeltery.net/fonts/audimat">Audimat</a> in the block
  cut-sort of effect. But, I didn&rsquo;t like Audimat for the headers as I was
  using it before. So I replaced them with the rather popular
  <a href="http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kaffeesatz/">Kaffeesatz</a>,
  by Yanone &mdash; an eminently readable sans-serif typeface with a whimsical
  kind of handwritten feeling. I picked it mostly because, outside of being
  beautifully treated by Yanone, it&rsquo;s rather condensed, and I love its
  relatively large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height">x-height</a>.
  I&rsquo;ve got a thing for big x-heights.
</p>

<p>
  X-height and whimsy also led me to my choice of body font: a serif face by
  Oriol Esparraguera called
  <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/afta-serif">Afta Serif</a>. I was
  drawn to its visual rhythm; it&rsquo;s fairly light in weight, and the curves
  are a bit squarish, which combined with the generous x-height emphasizes the
  whitespace and increases (in my opinion) readability. I also love the lowercase
  &ldquo;k&rdquo; letterform.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I tweaked the homepage layout to be single column, as I felt the old
  two columns were too claustrophobic and it felt nice to simplify.
</p>

<p>
  I still need to do up the darn <a href="/tags.html">tags page</a>, which
  I&rsquo;d never touched to begin with since moving to Jekyll. Also, after
  spending <a href="/2012/12/04/trust-in-styleguide">an entire blog
    post preaching about it</a>, I need to do a styleguide
  for this site.
</p>

<p>
  But, this redesign-ish work has gotten my juices flowing. Maybe I&rsquo;ll
  actually start posting more regularly!
