    Bittersweet post here, to announce that I&rsquo;ve left
    <a href="http://howaboutwe.com" target="_blank">HowAboutWe</a> to do frontend development
    for <a href="http://bonobos.com" target="_blank">Bonobos</a>&rsquo; New York Office.

  It&rsquo;s bitter because the HowAboutWe team is the best I&rsquo;ve
  ever worked with. Not surprising, because the standard and
  culture there was cultivated by my good friend, the brilliant
  <a href="http://tx.pignata.com/">John Pignata</a> (now at Groupme), who as CTO
  two years ago lured me into the startup world as employee five (or
  thereabouts). It was a flat and flexible team, with no frontend or backend
  divisions &mdash; just web developers, achieving the singular goal of a
  successful web product.
</p>

<p>
  Their growth (and my growth) over the past two years has been astounding, and
  I can&rsquo;t be grateful enough for that, and being allowed to help shape it,
  too. If you&rsquo;re looking to work with one of the best teams in New York,
  and are up to a challenge that&rsquo;s far more than just coding, then
  <a href="http://www.howaboutwe.com/jobs" target="_blank">drop them a
  resum&#233;</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Now the sweet stuff. When thinking about what&rsquo;s next after two years
  of the amazing HowAboutWe, one of the options that came to mind, literally,
  was Bonobos. As you <a href="/2012-05-19-trying-out-knit-ties">may</a>
  <a href="/2012/05/20/gh-bass-brockton">have</a>
  <a href="/2012/07/01/ratio-clothing-review">noticed</a>, I&rsquo;m
  <a href="/2012/06/10/online-made-to-measure-for-the-shorted">into
  menswear</a>. Bonobos, as a producer of quality menswear that started out
  online, would be perfect, <em>if only they had a New York technology team</em>,
  I thought. (It&rsquo;d be a good fit, if you will. You won&rsquo;t? Okay&hellip;)
</p>

<p>
  Cut to today when they&rsquo;ve cleared a space for me as their first New
  York-based frontend developer, with machinations of fleshing out a larger tech
  team here at their headquarters in my favorite city, and it&rsquo;s as if they
  read my mind. I&rsquo;ve joined at somewhat a hectic time, with Cyber Monday
  looming large in their Chelsea office. But I don&rsquo;t mind hitting the
  ground running and I&rsquo;m excited to apply my HowAboutWe growth at Bonobos
  (which, by the way, has a frontend in desperate need of help). And as another
  plus, I get to occasionally get out of town to visit their Palo Alto office.
</p>

<p>
  So, hello, Bonobos! And thanks, HowAboutWe! And I guess, expect some Bonobos
  product reviews on this blog soon. :)
