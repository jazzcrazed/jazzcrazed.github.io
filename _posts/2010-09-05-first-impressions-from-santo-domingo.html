  I am disgustingly ill-traveled. The last time I was out of the country was to
  play a wedding in Turks and Caicos, and I barely went outside the hotel. I
  haven't taken a vacation for longer than a few days in nearly my entire working
  life -- and never much further than my hometown in Virginia. And so this
  ten-day vacation to the Dominican Republic to visit my fiancee's home, friends,
  and family should be a well overdue shock to this travel-noob's nerves. Here's
  a few of my first impressions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The airport thirty miles outside of downtown Santo Domingo
      is pretty much like every airport I've been to. If I didn't pay attention
      to the language on the signs (or in some cases even if I did), I could
      easily mistake it for La Guardia.
    </p>

    <p>
      The area just outside the airport is starkly different. Driving west down DR-3
      (towards downtown), the expressway is lined to the south by the ocean, and to
      the north by blocks of dessicated structures of cinderblock and wood. Occasional
      smatterings of scaffolding and construction machinery make it hard to distinguish
      whether it's new development or decay at times; but large pyramids of trash and
      debris make me lean towards the latter.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the six-lane DR-3, vehicles and people alike share the pavement. Cars, vans,
      and trucks whipped past men and women leaning on the narrow median and sauntering
      along the lane lines as if they were built into the roads themselves. I consider
      them crazy not for crossing a trafficked six-lane expressway, but for trusting
      the drivers on it with their lives.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Traveling from the airport and through downtown Santo Domingo
      affirmed my general distaste for driving. Some disclosure, I hate getting behind
      the wheel even in the safest, quietest, and widest roads of well-paved suburbs
      (and honestly, you should probably question anew your travel options if you
      find me at the wheel of the car you're in). But Jason Bourne himself would find
      driving here a trial.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dominican traffic I've been exposed to so far is most notably comprised of
      rusted out Toyota Corollas (the vast majority so far) and other compacts,
      Japanese SUVs, occasional BMWs, the only Chevy Nova I've ever seen in person,
      tiny Daihatsu trucks, motorcycles, and small buses called guaguas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simply put, Dominican guaguas are buses and vans owned and run by private
      owners or labor unions in areas lacking sufficient municipal transit. They
      resemble in concept the dollar vans of Brooklyn -- Ford Econolines and Chevy
      Astros that honk to make their presence known to potential passengers as they
      stream up and down Flatbush Avenue. The guaguas here, too, make random pickups
      and stops, and are, according to Isa, more present than the state-run OMSA
      buses. However, they look like this:

    <p>
      The off-roader style fenders are quite literally a sort of traffic sweeper.
      It's a fair expectation for drivers here that they will bump into things --
      and, in the case of guaguas, with intent. Dings and scars, and in one case a
      mattress affixed artfully to the rear of one guagua with packing tape, told a
      story of jockeying as the driving norm on Santo Domingo streets.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've noticed that honking one's horn here is more a sort of courtesy than an
      expression of anger or irritation -- a "hello! I'm here in your blind spot!"
      kind of greeting. It's a useful hail at times; more than just guaguas are
      worse for wear here, and in cases where tail lights are busted, a quick wave
      of a hand out a driver's window is sometimes all that precedes an abrupt merge.
      My future father-in-law braked, swerved, and gunned around all of this chaos
      with relative aplomb.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      The neighborhood of Isa's childhood and where her parents
      still reside is called Arroyo Hondo, which means "deep stream." It's a wealthy
      area set on steep, picturesque hills just outside of Santo Domingo Este. Windy
      streets are lined with incredibly lush vegetation, and the houses are
      magnificent and immensely gated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Isa's parents' apartment is in a community called Isabel Villas, named for the
      nearby Rio Isabel (Isabel River -- no relation to Isa, though everyone apparently
      asks). There's a golf course nearby, and a guardhouse sits at its entrance.
      Across the narrow road in a dusty lot is a band of motoconchos -- taxis
      comprised of small and ratty motorcycles whose drivers await the servants of
      the community to finish their days' duties and seek out a ride back down the
      winding streets into downtown.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      One piece of advice from Isa and her fellow medical school
      graduate DR expats that's resounded since long before we arrived is this: Don't
      drink the tap water. It's not potable, according to them, and my gastro-intestinal
      system raised on a sterile Virginian diet is especially too tender for what runs
      through Dominican plumbing. So I take from standard water-cooler-style jugs of
      filtered water, poised in a clever metal rack that tilts to angle the spout
      into the drinking implement of choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another reminder that I'm a long way from New York is right next to the jugs
      of filtered water. Three rows of car batteries line the walls, and are rigged
      into an inverter, ready and waiting for inevitable brownouts.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      So far, since arriving at the airport until now, nearly two
      full days into my stay, I've not heard barely more than a whisper of distant
      merengue or bachata, or much of any music in general. Washington Heights, with
      its idling SUVs blaring La Mega, this most certainly is not, but Isa assures
      me that this won't be the case for long. She does, after all, hate the music
      for a reason. What I have heard plenty of, however, are roosters, somewhere at
      a nearby neighbor's house. They cock-a-doodle-do reliably in the morning; though,
      one sings well into the afternoon. Various birds and insects crow and chirp
      through the day, and I couldn't be happier about it.
    </p>

      The orange soda I've had so far here is Fanta, procured from
      a nearby Super Mercado Nacional. It's as sweet as snow-cone syrup, and around
      600 calories per serving, and takes me about as long to finish a single twenty
      ounce bottle as it does a dram of neat whiskey. Definitely a sippers' soda, to
      be taken on the rocks or not to be taken at all.

<p>
  Overall, it's humid, but breezy, beautiful and relaxing here. The only way I
  really noticed the humidity, actually, was when I noticed after a day that the
  corners of my passport were curling up all on their own. Unlike my passport, I
  find it really comfortable here -- infinitely better than the climate in our
  Brooklyn apartment. I'm utterly grateful that Isa chose this for our vacation,
  and that her parents are graciously hosting us, and I'm certain already that
  it'll be hard to head back at the end of our ten days here.
