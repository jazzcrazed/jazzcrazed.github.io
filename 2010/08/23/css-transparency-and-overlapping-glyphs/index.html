<p><code>rgba()</code> is a supremely useful <span class="caps">CSS</span> value. But I noticed, while
working on the footer of this site down below, that operating systems render
typography using this value in interesting&nbsp;ways.</p>
<h2>About <span class="caps">CSS</span>&nbsp;transparency</h2>

<p>
  To start, a quick overview. <code>rgba()</code> is a <span class="caps">CSS</span> property value
  specified in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgba-color"><span class="caps">CSS3</span>
  color module</a> that allows one to set in single value the traditional
  red/green/blue color sub-values, as well as a fourth sub-value for
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha transparency</a>.
  The syntax is pretty straightforward: <code>rgba(red,green,blue,alpha)</code>,
  where red, green, and blue are specified either as a percentage (0 to 100%) or
  as a number from 0 to 255, and alpha is specified as a decimal value — “1”
  translating to 100% opaque, “.5” is 50% transparent, “0” is completely
  transparent,&nbsp;etc.
</p>

<p>
  The awesomeness of this idea is that with <code>rgba()</code> as a value, it
  can be applied on any <span class="caps">CSS</span> property where color values are accepted, such as
  <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code>, <code>text-shadow</code>,
  what-have-you. The end result is the ability to apply individual levels of
  transparency to a single <span class="caps">CSS</span> selector for different properties — for instance,
  you can set your background to one transparency, and your text to another.
  Contrast this with the older <code>opacity</code> <span class="caps">CSS</span> property, which applies
  an alpha transparency value (in the same 0 to 1 decimal scale) to the entire
  selector — meaning, the selected element and any of its children would all
  get the same opacity, background, text, and&nbsp;all.
</p>

<h2>Rendering issues with overlapping&nbsp;glyphs</h2>

<p>
  While tooling around with my footer down below, I noticed <code>rgba()</code>
  being even more granular than I wanted it to be with regards to typefaces that
  naturally had overlapping glyphs. I had my footer set to something like&nbsp;this:
</p>

<p>
  <pre>
  .myFooter {
    font-family: DeftoneStylusRegular;
    color: rgba(255,255,255,.2);
  }
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  Via <code>@font-face</code>, I’m using <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com">
  Ray Larabie’s</a> <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Deftone-Stylus">
  Deftone Stylus</a>, which is a retro styled script font that’s intentionally
  kerned so that there’s overlap for the glyph connectors, as are most script
  fonts. The above <span class="caps">CSS</span> would set the text’s color to be white with 20% opacity.
  And the result looked like&nbsp;this:
</p>

<figure class="fullWidth">
  <div class="curledShadow">
    <img src="/images/a17d19ac55f1f16b3029cf026823e47d-300x134.png" alt="Example of overlapping glyphs using CSS rgba()">
  </div>
  <figcaption>Example of overlapping glyphs using <span class="caps">CSS</span> rgba()</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Where the glyphs’ serifs overlap to act as connectors, the opacity is multiplied.
  I created a simple little test to try to isolate what the issue&nbsp;was:
</p>

<p>
  <pre>
    &lt;style&gt;
    .test{
      font: bold 5em sans-serif;
      color:(0,0,0,.25);
      letter-spacing: -.2em;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;

    &lt;p class=”test”&gt;This is a test using rgba.&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  This uses the browser’s standard sans-serif typeface, sets it to black at 25%
  opacity via <code>rgba()</code>, and condenses the glyphs via negative <code>
  letter-spacing</code> to get overlap. It looks like this in Firefox 3.6 and
  Chrome 5 in <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;X:
</p>

<figure class="">          <div class="curledShadow"><img src="http://files.droplr.com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/24522365/1Az9cg.Screen%20shot%202010-08-23%20at%2013:37:52.png" alt="OS X screengrab of standard sans-serif font condensed via negative
    letter-spacing and set at 20% opacity via rgba()"></div><figcaption><span class="caps">OS</span> X screengrab of standard sans-serif font condensed via negative
    letter-spacing and set at 20% opacity via rgba()</figcaption></figure>

<p>
  As you can see, it appears as if each character is being targeted for
  transparency, and when they overlap they are treated as independent layers&hellip;
  in <span class="caps">OS</span> X, that is. Take a look at the same in Windows Firefox and&nbsp;Chrome:
</p>

<figure class="">          <div class="curledShadow"><img src="http://gyazo.com/8e193b94ebb9668356b341ab64892f0d.png" alt="Windows screengrab of standard sans-serif font condensed via negative
    letter-spacing and set at 20% opacity via rgba()"></div><figcaption>Windows screengrab of standard sans-serif font condensed via negative
    letter-spacing and set at 20% opacity via rgba()</figcaption></figure>

<p>
  In Windows, in either browser, it looks like it renders all the glyphs as a
  single vector object before then applying the transparency uniformly on the
  whole shebang. So my best guess is that browsers use <span class="caps">OS</span>-level compositing here,
  and there are discrepencies between operating systems. Most unfortunate, if
  you’re aiming for semi-transparent typography that has intentional glyph
  overlap. However, there’s a way out via&nbsp;opacity:
</p>

<p>
  <pre>
    &lt;style&gt;
    .test{
      font: bold 5em sans-serif;
      color: #000;
      letter-spacing: -.2em;
      opacity: .25;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;

    &lt;p class=”test”&gt;This is a test using opacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  This should actually look exactly the same as the first example — and that
  much is true in Windows. However, in <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;X:
</p>

<figure class="">          <div class="curledShadow"><img src="http://files.droplr.com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/24522365/1AAw76.Screen%20shot%202010-08-23%20at%2014%3A34%3A44.png" alt="OS X screengrab of standard sans-serif font condensed via negative
    letter-spacing and set at 20% opacity via opacity"></div><figcaption><span class="caps">OS</span> X screengrab of standard sans-serif font condensed via negative
    letter-spacing and set at 20% opacity via opacity</figcaption></figure>

<p>
  It looks just like Windows does — and actually, it looks the way I had
  originally intended. And this makes sense, since according to
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#transparency">the spec regarding <span class="caps">CSS</span>
  transparency</a>, “<em>…after the element (including its descendants) is
  rendered into an <span class="caps">RGBA</span> offscreen image, the opacity setting specifies how to
  blend the offscreen rendering into the current composite rendering.</em>“ In
  otherwords, render the elements at full opacity, and then crank the opacity
  down post-rendering based on the <code>opacity</code> property value before
  finally rendering on screen. Conceivably, <code>rgba()</code> is the same
  thing, only with multiple layers nested across multiple properties — but
  turns out <span class="caps">OS</span> X takes it a step further with text by isolating each&nbsp;glyph.
</p>

<p>
  Check out <a href="/demos/alphafonts/index.html">this test page</a> for the
  above examples (make sure to view in both Windows and <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;X).
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Honestly, this shouldn’t make a big difference in the vast majority of
  situations where traditional sans-serif or serif fonts are in use, as their
  glyphs don’t usually overlap. But think twice about it if you’re thinking
  about applying transparency to text set using a font with intentional character
  overlap — which includes just about all script fonts. Here’s an example of
  just a few, including Deftone Stylus which I used in my footer — these are
  at their default kerning, with no forced condensing via <code>letter-spacing</code>:
</p>

    Demo of fonts with intentional glyph overlap.
  </a>
<p></p><p></p>
<p></p>
  If I wanted to apply transparency to text using any of the fonts in the above
  demo, I’d have to forego <code>rgba()</code> in favor of wrapping the text in
  its own element, and then targeting that element with <code>opacity</code>,
  instead. That’s exactly what I ended up doing for my footer, by the way. It
  means extra <span class="caps">DOM</span> elements, but at least it works!

<h2>Note about Opera in&nbsp;Windows</h2>

<p>
  In <span class="caps">OS</span> X, Opera 10.61 looks much the same as Firefox and Chrome. But in Windows,
  it has some issues with certain typefaces when transparency is used in any&nbsp;form:
</p>

    when transparency is applied">
<p></p><p></p>
<p>
  As you can see, it’s cutting off certain glyphs along the vertical. Not sure
  what the issue is, but I haven’t hunted around much for answers, either, so
  I’ll update this if I find&nbsp;anything.
