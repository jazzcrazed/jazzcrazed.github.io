    <p>
      I&rsquo;m Marco Carag, a <del>Brooklyn</del> Queens-based web
      developer.
    </p>

    <p>

      <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatiron_District">Flatiron</a>.

    <p>
      I also organize a couple meetups:

    <p>
      I have a degree in Communications Design from <a href="http://www.pratt.edu">

      and <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101625155591132408533/albums/5627200706857952081">

    </p>

    <p>
      When not coding (which is often) or not hanging out with my fiance&#233;
      (which is rarely), I enjoy playing video games, listening to or performing
      Latin music, and
      <a href="/2012/07/25/just-upgraded-to-olympus-e-p3/">trying to use my camera</a>.
