<p>The sandbox smash, <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, is really
fun. Setting up, port-forwarding to, and maintaining a multiplayer server, all
while moderating against and booting out &ldquo;griefers&rdquo; really sucks.
So, don&rsquo;t do any of that, and use
<a href="http://www.minefold.com">Minefold</a>,&nbsp;instead.</p>

<p>
I love <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>. After my curiosity
was piqued by a random video of someone accidentally burning their blocky
house to the ground, I nabbed the alpha version, and have moved countless
blocks since. I love it especially because there’s no objectives, no missions,
no timers; I can do whatever I want, at whatever pace I want. A true&nbsp;sandbox.
</p><p>
When it comes to sharing Minecraft worlds, options are slightly limited. There’s
Minecraft server software that can be run on a machine for sharing on a local
network. Or the wider Internet with the right port-forwarding router setup. I’d
rather pay a bit to have all that hardware and setup handled for&nbsp;me.
</p>

<p>
Amazing, then, what the hosting service <a href="http://minefold.com">Minefold</a>
offers for free: ten hours of play a month on an unlimited number of Minecraft
worlds. It turns out ten hours a month is way beyond ample for my casual playing
needs. If somehow it’s ever not enough, there are unlimited play “Pro” options
starting at $15 for three months, and getting cheaper with six- and twelve-month
commitments. After a brainless signup (designer Chris Lloyd did an amazing job
with Minefold’s elegant design), you can upload your existing locally-created
worlds, or easily start a new one. At its most basic, it’s the perfect way to
cloud-store your worlds. But there&rsquo;s more to it than just the&nbsp;basics.
</p><p>
Minefold has two major strokes of genius, both setting it apart from other
competitors that I considered back when I was looking. The first is that you’re
charged for play time &mdash; not for the servers. What this means is that you don’t
need to worry about capacity costs or anything of the sort; if you have a dozen
other players participating, however much they play is their own problem and
their own bill, just the same as with your own participation. And on that note,
allowing other players in is akin to adding them as a friend on Facebook; they
put in a request, and you approve it. There’s no other way about it, which
makes preventing “griefers” (in the “speak”) an easy thing to do, if you keep
approvals close to your&nbsp;chest.

<p>
The second stroke of genius is how worlds are shared. To start, your world and
the literally thousands of other worlds created by other users have wonderful
“profile” pages, centering around a truly awesome Google Maps-driven
isometric pan-able and zoom-able view of the world as it’s so far been explored.
This is actually an incredibly useful feature; not only have I spent countless
minutes panning and zooming around finding things in this map of my world that
I didn’t notice when actually wandering in Minecraft, but I’ve often kept it
open to use as a real map while I played the game&nbsp;simultaneously.
</p>

    Exploring your own and other people&rsquo;s worlds &mdash; and cloning them
    &mdash; is a downright pleasurable experience.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Obviously, it’s also a wonderful way to experience what others have created.
Thumbnails of these isometric maps can be browsed in an “Explore” page, and you
can click into any world’s “profile” page. And to top it off, you can clone any
world you come across to claim as your own. This means that you can experience
other people’s creations without having to trouble yourself with getting
approval as a participant in their exact original of that world. Seriously,
Minefold solves all the problems of safe and easy multiplayer Minecraft with its
browsing, cloning and approval&nbsp;system.
</p>

<p>
Did I mention that all of this is free? You don’t pay a dime until you’ve
surpassed ten hours of play time in a given month. What a deal, especially for
the casual player. For making multiplayer Minecraft painless, brainless,
griefer-free, and just plain pleasurable to use &mdash; even when not playing
&mdash; <a href="http://www.minefold.com">Minefold</a> is the way to&nbsp;go.
